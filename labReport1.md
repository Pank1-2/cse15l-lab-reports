1. First, if you haven't already reset the password for your CSE15L account, go to the link attached [here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) and it will ask for your UCSD username and your PID. 
2. Once you've entered that, you should see a CSE15l account associated with your information. Click that and follow the steps to reset your password. 
3. When you've done that, you'll need to download VSCode on your device. To download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), follow the instructions on the site to download the latest version. 
4. Once you finish downloading VSCode and you open the app on your device it should look something like this. ![Image](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks/getstarted_page.png) Make sure you are downloading the one that is compatible with your device. 
5. Next, you're going to want to open a terminal on VSC by doing *Ctrl or Command + `* or you can use menu option at the top where it says Terminal and navigate to the New Terminal option.
